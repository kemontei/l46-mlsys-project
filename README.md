# L46 MLSys project repo

This repo contains the source code and experiments performed in the *Compression techniques for deep neural networks* project for the L46 (Principles of Machine Learning Systems) course.

* The data preprocessing, training and evaluation code can be found in `mlsys_project_main.ipynb`.

* `compression_pipelines.ipynb` contains the experiments conducted by combining compression techniques.

* Additional performance data such as peak memory usage, MACs, and accuracy after converting models to the TFLite format can be found in `macs_and_memory_usage.ipynb`.
